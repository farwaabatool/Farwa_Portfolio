# Data Analysis Projects

Following are the examples of Data analysis projects to showcase the experience with different analytical tools.

## Project 1: Data Exploration with SQL

Using SQL server to explore data for an insurance company customer database. The analysis gave a clearer picture of the company's customer base and how to target that segment.

## Project 2: Data Exploration using R with sql packages

The R packages for SQL i.e 'sqldf' and 'SQLite' were used to explore the employee database for an apparel company. The analysis helped get a better understanding of the employees of the company and how to increase their productivity.

## Project 3: Customer Analysis using BTYD package and CLVTools package in R

To gauge the customer lifetime value of a snacks company and an apparel company, CLVTools and BTYD package. CLVTools enables us to get accurate the lifetime value of a customer, whereas BTYD predicts the cunsomer behaviour. These packages in the analysis helped in making the customer acquisition process more efficient and increasing the retention rate.

An interesting project by Joon Park and Cathy He of Knight Lab to sharpen SQL skills. By using queries involving functions such as JOIN, WHERE, ORDER BY the killer is found hidden in the dataset. The dataset is built in SQLite as "sqlite_master". You can check the mystery [here](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)
